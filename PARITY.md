# Parity report

> This report established parser parity before configurable bounds were added.
> The current default uses marker-inclusive, head-tail tool-result truncation
> and the canonical `claude-code` source ID. Oversized tool results and Claude
> metadata therefore intentionally differ from the production reference
> measured below. Argument normalization retains the documented behavior.

Local differential checks were run on 2026-07-10 against 1,050 on-device
sessions without retaining or printing transcript content:

- 1,006 Claude Code JSONL files
- 44 Codex rollout JSONL files

The harness compares SHA-256 hashes first. Full normalized records are written
only to a temporary directory for mismatches, classified without printing
content, and deleted when the run exits. Files that change between passes are
excluded using byte-level input hashes.

## ATIF interchange format

The ATIF adapter was implemented against the active Harbor ATIF RFC and its
reference Pydantic models as of 2026-08-19. The reference accepts schema
versions `ATIF-v1.0` through `ATIF-v1.7`; automated coverage exercises every
published version plus a sanitized v1.7 trajectory containing multimodal
content, reasoning, multiple tool calls, linked observations, model metadata,
run/document identity, and an external subagent reference.

A privacy-safe bulk pass then covered 3,373 Harbor-generated trajectories
(499,643,224 bytes) from a local benchmark corpus: 403 ATIF-v1.2, 793
ATIF-v1.5, and 2,177 ATIF-v1.6 documents produced by eight agent integrations.
All files were valid JSON, all had `session_id`, and none changed during the
pass. Strict whole-transcript normalization succeeded for 2,583 files; 746
OpenCode exports omitted user steps and 44 otherwise incomplete exports omitted
assistant steps, so they correctly failed the shared whole-conversation
invariants. With explicit partial-transcript semantics, all 3,373 normalized
successfully to 311,712 records. Canonical normalization also succeeded for all
files with native identity for all 308,339 body records and no duplicate record
IDs within a trajectory.

The corpus exercised 118,613 tool calls and 89,366 observation results. Of the
results, 33,845 intentionally had no `source_call_id` (the Terminus family uses
one unlinked observation per agent step); all 33,845 were preserved as generic
`observation` records without inventing tool links. The 609 system steps remain
omitted by default and raise the explicit-inclusion total to 312,321 records.
Other aggregate cleanup was 19,397 synthesized timestamps, 215 synthesized
tool-call IDs, 87 argument truncations, and 9,519 result truncations under the
default bounds. Intentional target-schema differences are documented beside
the adapter: embedded subagent timelines, metrics, and custom metadata have no
equivalent in trajectory-v1.

## Amp whole-thread export

The Amp adapter was checked on 2026-08-22 against two actual whole-thread JSON
documents emitted by `amp threads export` from installed Amp
`0.0.1787378726-g9570e9`. Both threads used the thread-actor representation and
reported the sandbox executor used by Amp orbs. The audit inspected aggregate
keys, types, statuses, and counts only; no real transcript prose, reasoning,
tool payload, path, repository, account, device, or thread identifier was
printed or retained in this repository.

The complete orb export had 126 messages (63 user, 62 assistant, one info), 134
uniquely linked complete tool calls/results, and a final complete assistant
turn. It normalized to 421 canonical records: one meta, two user, 138
reasoning, 12 assistant prose, 134 assistant tool-call, and 134 tool-result
records. All 420 body records used native protocol-message identity and were
ordered by the source message array plus numeric component index. Diagnostics
were one dropped compaction info record, 78 default-bound tool-result
truncations, and 134 timestamp interpolations for result messages whose native
export had no timestamp. No incompleteness, orphan, duplicate, or synthesized
identity diagnostic occurred.

The actively written orb export normalized to 36 records with exactly one
`incomplete_transcript` diagnostic because it ended after terminal tool results
before assistant continuation. This preserves the observable prefix without
misclassifying tool transport as a human turn or inventing the session-end event
that Amp does not expose. Sanitized fixtures cover the sandbox/orb envelope,
reasoning, structured linked tools, source-native status, sparse timestamps,
compaction info, multiple repository trees, incomplete blocks, duplicate
terminal results, malformed/truncated JSON, duplicate identity, unsupported
semantic blocks, non-terminal results, and unmatched tails.

## Production TypeScript reference

Reference: `letta-agent-sdk` `dream-pipeline` commit `3d3e3e0`.

- Seven Claude sessions were confirmed to exceed a one-second isolated timeout
  in the production argument truncator. They all complete in `trajectory` and
  were excluded from the bulk reference process so it could not hang.
- All 1,043 remaining normalization outcomes matched.
- Of 903 successful sessions, 902 normalized outputs matched exactly.
- The sole record mismatch was an intentional cap repair: production returned
  a 21,560-character tool-argument object unchanged even though the documented
  cap is 20,000; `trajectory` returned a valid 19,977-character object with a
  truncation marker.

The seven timeouts and the over-cap result share one cause: the legacy
truncation loop treats 2,000 characters as a hard per-string floor. It can
repeat forever or stop above the total cap when several fields collectively
cannot fit. `trajectory` preserves the legacy output whenever it terminates
under the cap, then uses a strictly decreasing fallback otherwise.

## Letta Code and OpenHands adapters

The Letta Code adapter was checked on 2026-07-22 against the complete local
`~/.letta/transcripts` tree without printing or retaining transcript content,
tool payloads, paths, or identifiers. This is the append-only client-side
`transcript.jsonl` used for reflection slicing and payload generation, not a
backend conversation-history store.

- The store contained 1,924 transcript files: 274 nonempty logs and 1,650
  empty logs. The nonempty logs contained 37,243 valid JSONL rows.
- All 274 nonempty logs normalized successfully. Empty logs correctly failed
  with `invalid_input` and are omitted by `listTrajectories()`.
- The corpus exercised `user`, `assistant`, `reasoning`, and `tool_call` rows,
  including older rows without source ids, failed tool results, and unfinished
  calls. All 21,991 completed tool rows normalized as linked call/result pairs;
  no orphan-result or synthesized-call-id diagnostics remained.
- Canonical replay assigned row-position identities to 17,104 records emitted
  from historical id-less rows, with no duplicate record ids within a log.
- Sanitized fixtures cover source-message versus source-line identity,
  reasoning/assistant components from one source message, completed and
  unfinished tools, failed results, malformed lines, error rows, unsupported
  row kinds, and row-position identity for older rows without source ids.

OpenHands message, action, observation, agent-error, and user-rejection event
shapes were checked against the `dream-pipeline` OpenHands source. Both the
array and `{items: [...]}` input forms produced exact production-equivalent
records in the compatibility fixtures.

## Hermes adapter

The Hermes adapter was checked on 2026-07-22 against the complete local
`~/.hermes/state.db` session store (7 sessions, 22 active message rows) without
printing or retaining message content. Each session was exported as the
documented `{session, messages}` envelope and normalized through both
`normalizeTranscript` and `normalizeToCanonical`:

- 6 of 7 sessions normalized cleanly with zero diagnostics (34 records).
- The remaining session contained only unanswered user messages and correctly
  failed strict validation with `missing_assistant_records`.
- The corpus confirmed epoch-second `time.time()` timestamps, string content
  rows, and duplicated `reasoning`/`reasoning_content` fields on reasoning
  turns.

The local corpus contained no tool-call rows, so tool-call decoding (OpenAI
Chat Completions dicts including Codex Responses `call_id` extras, the
simplified id-less `{name, arguments}` flush shape, JSON-string versus decoded
`tool_calls` columns, and the `\x00json:` multimodal content sentinel) was
implemented against the `hermes-agent` reference implementation
(`hermes_state.py` `append_message`/`get_messages` and the `run_agent.py`
session-flush path) and is covered by sanitized fixtures.

## OpenClaw adapter

The local OpenClaw session store (`agents/main/sessions`) was empty on this
machine, so the adapter was implemented against the `openclaw` reference
implementation as the compatibility baseline: the pi-coding-agent
`SessionManager` JSONL contract used by `config/sessions/transcript.ts`
(header + wrapper-row append), the `type: "message"`-only filtering used by
`memory/session-files.ts` and the TUI history loader, the
`{role: "toolResult", toolCallId, toolName, content, isError}` result shape,
`{type: "toolCall", id, name, arguments}` assistant blocks, and the
`delivery-mirror` placeholder model written by the assistant delivery mirror
(kept as prose, excluded from model metadata). Malformed JSONL lines are
recoverable diagnostics, mirroring OpenClaw's own session-file repair, which
drops them. Wrapper entry ids provide native canonical identity; rows without
ids anchor to the append-only byte offset. Sanitized fixtures cover the happy
path and the cleanup cases; no real transcript content was available or used.

## OMP (Oh My Pi) adapter

OMP is a fork of pi-mono and shares its SessionManager JSONL lineage, so the
`omp` adapter reuses the pi/openclaw shared decoder with the `omp` source
label and no model exclusions. The adapter was checked on 2026-07-24 against
the complete local `~/.omp/agent/sessions` primary-session tree (one level
under each escaped-cwd project directory) without printing or retaining
transcript content, tool payloads, paths, or identifiers:

- 363 primary session JSONL files were enumerated.
- 346 normalized successfully (116,056 records). 17 failed strict validation
  as expected — 12 `missing_user_records` and 5 `missing_assistant_records`
  from sessions containing only one conversational role.
- Diagnostics on successful sessions were exclusively default-bounds
  truncations (`tool_result_truncated`, `tool_arguments_truncated`); no
  `invalid_json_line`, `orphan_tool_result`, `duplicate_tool_call_id`, or
  `tool_call_id_synthesized` diagnostics appeared, confirming clean native
  tool-call↔result linkage and well-formed JSONL.
- The corpus exercised the v3 `{type:"session"}` header (`cwd`, no
  `git_branch`) and OMP-only entry types (`session_init`, `title`,
  `service_tier_change`, `mode_change`, `ttsr_injection`, and
  `custom`/`custom_message` rows), all silently dropped by the shared
  `type !== "message"` filter. Message roles were `user`, `assistant`, and
  `toolResult`; content blocks were `text`, `thinking`, and `toolCall`.

Sanitized synthetic fixtures cover the happy path (reasoning, linked tool
calls and results, model metadata) and cleanup (malformed line, orphan tool
result, failed/error result, skipped `bashExecution` role, image block,
OMP-only dropped entry types). No real transcript content was retained.

## Deep Agents SDK checkpoints

The `deepagents` fixture is generated by Python
`langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite` through `SqliteSaver.put()` and `put_writes()`.
An additional hermetic integration test runs `deepagents.create_deep_agent()`
with a deterministic tool-capable model and normalizes the SDK-created SQLite
checkpoint, so CI covers the actual SDK persistence contract without an API key.
It contains canonical `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage` reasoning/text/tool calls,
`ToolMessage`, model/cwd metadata, an ancestor checkpoint with message writes,
and a selected checkpoint with pending message writes. The fixture mirrors the
Deep Agents CLI store layout (`~/.deepagents/sessions.db`): multiple threads,
all in the root checkpoint namespace, with the latest checkpoint selected per
thread. Tests cover per-thread isolation and LangGraph Overwrite semantics.

A Python-generated fixture was also opened with the official JavaScript
`@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite` saver as an interoperability gate. The
JavaScript saver rejected Python's `msgpack` serializer type. The production
adapter therefore delegates to the official Python saver and message reducer
instead of decoding SQLite blobs or assuming cross-language wire compatibility.

## OpenCode native export

The OpenCode adapter was implemented against the native-format parser in
`letta-train` and a privacy-safe structural audit of public
`SALT-NLP/SWE-chat` raw transcripts. The corpus contained 623 `OpenCode` rows
plus one lowercase `opencode` row. The audit inspected aggregate keys, field
types, part/status values, and file sizes without retaining transcript content,
arguments, results, paths, or identifiers.

Native documents consistently used `{info, messages[].parts[]}`. Sampled tool
states included `completed`, `error`, and one unfinished `running` call. Part
IDs, call IDs, millisecond times, model, cwd, output, and string errors are
preserved. Of 17 native documents in the matched sample, 16 normalized
successfully (5,380 records); one valid but incomplete user-only session
correctly failed with `missing_assistant_records`.

Sanitized happy-path and cleanup fixtures cover reasoning, linked calls and
results, terminal status, metadata, unknown semantic records, and canonical
native identity. No source transcript content was copied into this repository.

## Gemini CLI native export

The Gemini CLI adapter was checked against a privacy-safe structural audit of
the public `SALT-NLP/SWE-chat` raw transcripts and the native-format parser in
`letta-train`. The corpus contained 59 `Gemini CLI` rows, although agent labels
were not reliable wire-format identifiers: some labelled files used another
supported capture shape and must be routed by content.

Native documents used `{sessionId, projectHash, messages[]}`. Sampled terminal
tool statuses were `success`, `error`, and `cancelled`; results used inline
`functionResponse.response` objects. All 15 native documents in the matched
sample normalized successfully (4,932 records).

Sanitized happy-path and cleanup fixtures cover thoughts, prose, linked inline
tool responses, structured status, unsupported message diagnostics, metadata,
and canonical native identity. The audit retained no transcript content,
arguments, results, paths, or identifiers.

## Cursor SWE-chat capture

The Cursor adapter targets the role/message JSONL capture present in the
public `SALT-NLP/SWE-chat` raw transcripts. A privacy-safe audit covered all 19
Cursor exports and inspected only aggregate keys, field types, block types,
and file sizes.

Every observed capture used `text` and `tool_use` content blocks. The corpus
contained no timestamps, native record IDs, tool-call IDs, or tool results, so
deterministic synthesized timestamps/call IDs and byte-offset canonical
identity are expected for this source. All 19 captures normalized successfully
(1,331 records) when canonical calls were supplied the corpus session ID.

Sanitized fixtures additionally exercise the compatible `thinking` and
`tool_result` blocks, including native IDs and structured error status when
present. Cleanup coverage includes malformed lines, unsupported rows/blocks,
and the required caller-owned canonical group. No source transcript content
was retained.

## GitHub Copilot CLI event export

The Copilot CLI adapter was checked against both event streams in the public
`SALT-NLP/SWE-chat` raw transcripts and the native-format parser in
`letta-train`. The privacy-safe audit inspected event/data keys, value types,
status values, and file sizes without retaining transcript prose, arguments,
results, paths, or identifiers.

Both captures exercised user-prompt hooks, plaintext `reasoningText`, tool
requests, successful results, and structured failed executions
(`success: false` with `{code, message}` errors). Both normalized successfully
(717 records).

Sanitized happy-path and cleanup fixtures cover session metadata, native event
identity, reasoning, linked calls/results, success/failure status, duplicated
transport events, malformed lines, and unsupported-event diagnostics.
